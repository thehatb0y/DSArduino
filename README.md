# Energy Efficiency Management System for Classrooms

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the Document

With increasing concerns about energy efficiency in educational institutions, addressing specific issues related to energy consumption in classrooms has become crucial. This project aims to mitigate these challenges by developing an integrated system that allows precise measurement and efficient management of energy usage, temperature, and luminosity in classrooms.

### 1.2 Project Scope

The primary goal is to create a hardware prototype capable of real-time data collection on various environmental conditions in classrooms, including energy consumption, temperature, and light levels. This data will be accessible through a Python API, offering flexibility and ease of integration with other systems. Continuous real-time data collection will enable quick responses to anomalies, ensuring more comfortable and efficient environments.

The proposed system will facilitate more efficient energy management in classrooms, contributing to reduced operational costs and promoting sustainable practices. This project aims to address energy efficiency challenges in educational settings by providing an integrated solution that combines innovative hardware, a robust API, and an intuitive web dashboard. Successful implementation of this system will not only optimize energy consumption but also enhance environmental awareness and support more sustainable practices in the academic context.
